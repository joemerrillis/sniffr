Below is a sequence of AI-generated captions for each photo taken on a dog walk. Write a friendly, energetic 2-3 sentence summary to send to the dog's human. Reference specific moments or moods from the captions, avoid repeating the captions directly, and focus on what made this walk special for the dogs. Don't repeat the dog's name every sentence. No bullet points. Write naturally as the walker or a friendly assistant.

// ---------- Event/Tag Extraction Prompt ----------
export function buildEventTagPrompt({ transcript }) {
  return `
Your job is to extract only events that inform us about the dog's experience, state of mind, or personality during the walk. Do NOT create events for human background actions (like closing doors, putting on shoes, opening gates) unless it clearly relates to the dog's reaction or mood. Focus on moments that reveal how the dog interacts with their environment, their human, or other dogs.

For each meaningful event, provide:
- "text": a single sentence describing the event, rephrased in a way that emphasizes the dog's perspective, mood, or response. Be specific.
For each tag, provide:
- "name": the tag (a single word or short phrase)
- "emoji": a single emoji matching the tag meaning (use your best guess)
- "description": a very short phrase (max 6 words) that gives a general definition of the tag, not specific to this walk or place.


Example output:
[
  {
    "text": "Juno cried with joy at being picked up for her walk.",
    "tags": [
      { "name": "joy", "emoji": "üòÑ", "description": "Expressed happiness" },
